            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Elsa Voss</strong>, and I'm a <em>sophomore</em> at <strong>UW Madison</strong> studying <strong>Information Science and Economics</strong>. I created this website because I believe that every college student deserves to eat well, even on a tight budget and busy schedule.</p>
            
            <p>I'm from Chicago, Illinois, where I worked at a Lifetime Fitness this summer. The community at lifetime encouraged and inspired me to prioritize my health. I started cooking for myself more, and built habits that I could bring to college with me this year.</p>

            <h3>My Cooking Philosophy</h3>
